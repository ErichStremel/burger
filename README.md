## Welcome to my Eat the Burger App! 

### This Application was built for a bootcamp project assignment. It utilizes MySQL, Express, Node.js, and Express-handlebars npm packages.

### The purpose of this app is for the user to create burgers and devour burgers. It presents an example of how a programmer can weave together an application using a few different front-end and back-end languages. 

### To open the application, clone the repository, run an npm install, and then run the "node server" command in your CLI.
